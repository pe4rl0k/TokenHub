This repository houses a Node.js server built with TypeScript, designed to serve a React-based frontend alongside offering API services crucial for interacting with blockchain token data and facilitating user authentication and token ownership management. The server integrates with blockchain networks to fetch token data, thereby enabling real-time tracking and management of digital assets. Additionally, it supports user authentication processes, allowing for secure token transactions and ownership adjustments. This setup aims to provide a seamless interface for users to interact with blockchain assets while ensuring data integrity and security through robust backend services.
